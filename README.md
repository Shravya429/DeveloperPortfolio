# DeveloperPortfolio
Welcome to my developer portfolio project!
This portfolio is built entirely using Lightning Web Components (LWC) to showcase my skills as a Salesforce Developer. It highlights my experience in building scalable and efficient solutions on the Salesforce platform.

In this project, I’ve integrated modern web development practices using LWC to create a responsive, user-friendly portfolio. It features projects I’ve worked on, including LWC-based applications like BMI calculators, alarm clocks with sound animations, and API-driven weather applications.

Feel free to explore the code and projects—this portfolio reflects my journey as a developer, continuously learning and evolving with the latest in Salesforce technology.
